    "This tutorial is an executable [Jupyter notebook](https://jupyter.org) hosted on [Jovian](https://www.jovian.ai) (don't worry if these terms seem unfamiliar; we'll learn more about them soon). You can _run_ this tutorial and experiment with the code examples in a couple of ways: *using free online resources* (recommended) or *on your computer*.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Option 1: Running using free online resources (1-click, recommended)\n",
    "\n",
    "The easiest way to start executing the code is to click the **Run** button at the top of this page and select **Run on Colab**. [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com) is a free online platform for running Jupyter notebooks using Google's cloud infrastructure. You can also select \"Run on Binder\" or \"Run on Kaggle\" if you face issues running the notebook on Google Colab.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Option 2: Running on your computer locally\n",
    "\n",
    "To run the code on your computer locally, you'll need to set up [Python](https://www.python.org), download the notebook and install the required libraries. We recommend using the [Conda](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/) distribution of Python. Click the **Run** button at the top of this page, select the **Run Locally** option, and follow the instructions.\n",

    ">  **Jupyter Notebooks**: This tutorial is a [Jupyter notebook](https://jupyter.org) - a document made of _cells_. Each cell can contain code written in Python or explanations in plain English. You can execute code cells and view the results, e.g., numbers, messages, graphs, tables, files, etc. instantly within the notebook. Jupyter is a powerful platform for experimentation and analysis. Don't be afraid to mess around with the code & break things - you'll learn a lot by encountering and fixing errors. You can use the \"Kernel > Restart & Clear Output\" or \"Edit > Clear Outputs\" menu option to clear all outputs and start again from the top."

    "\n",
    "The approach we've taken in this tutorial is very different from programming as you might know it. Usually, we write programs that take some inputs, perform some operations, and return a result. \n",
    "\n",
    "However, in this notebook, we've defined a \"model\" that assumes a specific relationship between the inputs and the outputs, expressed using some unknown parameters (weights & biases). We then show the model some know inputs and outputs and _train_ the model to come up with good values for the unknown parameters. Once trained, the model can be used to compute the outputs for new inputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "This paradigm of programming is known as _machine learning_, where we use data to figure out the relationship between inputs and outputs. _Deep learning_ is a branch of machine learning that uses matrix operations, non-linear activation functions and gradient descent to build and train models.
